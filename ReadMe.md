A hand gesture-controlled mouse is a computer input device that allows users to interact with a computer or other digital devices through hand movements and gestures, without the need for a physical mouse or other traditional input methods like a keyboard or touchpad. This technology typically relies on sensors or cameras to track and interpret the user's hand movements, enabling them to control the cursor's position on the screen, perform clicks, and execute various commands through specific gestures. Hand gesture-controlled mice are often used in applications like virtual reality, gaming, and presentations, providing a more intuitive and immersive way to interact with digital content.
